[[Final Year Project Mark Scheme.sheet|Mark Scheme]]

- Project Idea  - Photo Storage web app with react, that uses image recognition to tag and organise images and create collages based on those tags.

## Week 1 (16/09/24)

###  Lecture & Seminar
-  FYP is meant to demonstrate students ability to work on a longer term project individually
- Assessment Breakdown
	1.  Project proposal  - 10%  
	   - Document that includes:
		   - the reasons you are doing the project
		   - the methodology you will be using
		   - the objectives of the project
	2. Literature review and Methodology - 15%  
	   - Review of the reading done for the project (relevant documentation counts)
	3. Abstract and Introduction  and Requirements to Conclusions - 35%  
	   - Majority of the marks so is impotent to do well and start as early as possible
	4. Work Done - 20%  
	   - project progress as a whole
	5. Professional Working Practices - 10%  
	   - Engagement and attendance of seminars is important for this
	6. Presentation - 10%
	   - Finished project demonstration
	   - Has to be deployed in a live environment and be accessible through an app or a website
   - We also covered logbooks and how they should document your progress throughout the project development process

###  Project Development (18-19/09/24)
-  For this week with my project development, I have yet to think of an idea for my project. However I know that I want my project to use the react frame work and so it would need to be a web based project. I for next week I want to find a project idea that I could find interesting, but I don't have an idea of what my project could be.
###  Advanced web development
-  this week was an introduction to the module where we had a brief summary of the lecture the history of the web, and how the web developed from static to dynamic pages. 
- We also covered data exchange formats used in the web like XML, CSV and JSON, with JSON and XML being the most prominent of the three in the modern era
	- With notably widespread use in web API's to transfer information on request


## Week 2 (23/09/24)
###  Lecture & Seminar
- We covered proposal writing during the lecture including:
	- Things the proposal should include
		- What you are going to do
		- Who the project could benefit
		- The reasons you are doing the project
		- The objectives of the project
		- Methodology of the project i.e. waterfall, agile etc.
		- Gantt chart and logbook
	- The proposal would be due in week 4 (wb 07/10/24)
- During the Seminar covered :
	 - Project should be more complicated than second year CSS
	 - Should be mindful of ethical approval - and the implication of the topic/ project idea I choose
		 - might have to adjust project to fit with ethical approval, and reduce the load of work for 
	- Project would most likely end up being a proto-type so focus on what the final project would be capable of doing
		- However don't keep leave time for write-up and not just focus on packing a lot of features into the project for the sake of it
	- Engagement and attendance in the seminars is important at it count toward the working professional section of our proposal grade

###  Project Development (25-26/09/24)
- For the second week of project development I decided on making a Photo Storage web app using react, but since that wasn't a complex enough  project I decide to add image recognition that tags and organise images uploaded to the web app to create collages based on those tags.
	- This project aims to help people get a curated set of collages through the use of AI
	- I plan to use an image recognition framework in node.js as that is the back end solution that I am initially planning on using.

###  Advanced web development
- This week we covered frameworks and the framework we would be using during the module symfony. Symfony is a PHP framework that allows you to build PHP web applications faster due to the generic modules it offers.
	- When symphony gets a web request (/about) it goes through the kernel which takes it to the controller where the code for the view is and any arguments are resolved and then sent to the call controller to be turned to a rendered view and send back to the client as a response.


## Week 3 (30/09/24)
### # Lecture & Seminar
- The lecture this week covered different development methods we could use for our projects:
	- We covered research based projects that pick a topic and research about it and create a product, with their project being focused on answering a research question and and code done/ app made would be used to help find the answer to that research question
	- We also covered the agile methodology and how it uses an iterative and incremental cycle where you complete sections of your project going through the whole development cycle
- The seminar this week we covered more proposal writing tips
	- We went over writing about alternative methods that could be used in your proposal methodology and why you wouldn't be using them
		- also to talk what parts of your chosen  the methodology you are using  and not using
-  we also covered how out project objectives shouldn't just be software features and should include parts of the development cycle like testing.
-  We also shared out project ideas with our project supervisors to get feedback on any potential problems
	- My feedback was to look into the viability of image recognition with the react framework since I already had an idea of the framework that I wanted to use.

###  Project Development (2-3/10/24)
- For the third week I followed my supervisors feedback form earlier in the week and tested an image recognition module from node. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20241011142746.png]]
	- I created a new react app to test how viable this was, I use the tensor-flow module in node and made a basic UI with an image upload form.
		- I tested it with an apple and got a response after around 12 second of an apple with 95.04% confidence on whether it was correct
###  Advanced web development
- During this week we covered templating and how it works in symphony.
	- We covered how templating is the process of making placeholder values for content on a web page so actual values can be put in at a later stage after some data processing has occurred
	- We talked about how traditional php templating put you at risk of code injection and the fact that it was hard to maintain as the values were hard to transfer between different templates
		- The solution to
