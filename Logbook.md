	- With notably widespread use in web API's to transfer information on request

## Project Development
-  For this week with my project development, I have yet to think of an idea for my project. However I know that I want my project to use the react frame work and so it would need to be a web based project. I for next week I want to find a project idea that I could find interesting, but I have  no idea of what it may be right now

	- However don't keep leave time for write-up and not just focus on packing a lot of features into the project for the sake of it
