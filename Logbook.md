[[Final Year Project Mark Scheme.sheet|Mark Scheme]]

- Project Idea  - Photo Storage web app with react, that uses image recognition to tag and organise images and create collages based on those tags.

## Week 1 (16/09/24)

## Lecture & Seminar
-  FYP is meant to demonstrate students ability to work on a longer term project individually
- Assessment Breakdown
	1.  Project proposal  - 10%  
	   - Document that includes:
		   - the reasons you are doing the project
		   - the methodology you will be using
		   - the objectives of the project
	2. Literature review and Methodology - 15%  
	   - Review of the reading done for the project (relevant documentation counts)
	3. Abstract and IntroductionÂ  and Requirements to Conclusions - 35%  
	   - Majority of the marks so is impotent to do well and start as early as possible
	4. Work Done - 20%  
	   - project progress as a whole
	5. Professional Working Practices - 10%  
	   - Engagement and attendance of seminars is important for this
	6. Presentation - 10%
	   - Finished project demonstration
	   - Has to be deployed in a live environment and be accessible through an app or a website
   - We also covered logbooks and how they should document your progress throughout the project development process

## Project Development (18-19/09/24)
-  For this week with my project development, I have yet to think of an idea for my project. However I know that I want my project to use the react frame work and so it would need to be a web based project. I for next week I want to find a project idea that I could find interesting, but I don't have an idea of what my project could be.
## Advanced web development
-  this week was an introduction to the module where we had a brief summary of the lecture the history of the web, and how the web developed from static to dynamic pages. 
- We also covered data exchange formats used in the web like XML, CSV and JSON, with JSON and XML being the most prominent of the three in the modern era
	- With notably widespread use in web API's to transfer information on request


## Week 2 (23/09/24)
## Lecture & Seminar
- We covered proposal writing during the lecture including:
	- Things the proposal should include
		- What you are going to do
		- Who the project could benefit
		- The reasons you are doing the project
		- The objectives of the project
		- Methodology of the project i.e. waterfall, agile etc.
		- Gantt chart and logbook
	- The proposal would be due in week 4 (wb 07/10/24)
- During the Seminar covered :
	 - Project should be more complicated than second year CSS
	 - Should be mindful of ethical approval - and the implication of the topic/ project idea I choose
		 - might have to adjust project to fit with ethical approval, and reduce the load of work for 
	- Project would most likely end up being a proto-type so focus on what the final project would be capable of doing
		- However don't keep leave time for write-up and not just focus on packing a lot of features into the project for the sake of it
	- Engagement and attendance in the seminars is important at it count toward the working professional section of our proposal grade

## Project Development (25-26/09/24)
- For the second week of project development I decided on making a Photo Storage web app using react, but since that wasn't a complex enough  project I decide to add image recognition that tags and organise images uploaded to the web app to create collages based on those tags.
	- This project aims to help people get a curated set of collages through the use of AI
	- I plan to use an image recognition framework in node.js as that is the back end solution that I am initially planning on using.

## Advanced web development
- This week we covered frameworks and the framework we would be using during the module symfony. Symfony is a PHP framework that allows you to build PHP web applications faster due to the generic modules it offers.
	- When symphony gets a web request (/about) it goes through the kernel which takes it to the controller where the code for the view is and any arguments are resolved and then sent to the call controller to be turned to a rendered view and send back to the client as a response.


## Week 3 (30/09/24)
## Lecture & Seminar

## Project Development (2-3/10/24)

## Advanced web development


### Seminar
- The lecture this week covered different development methods we could use for our projects

- Mention what other methods apart from agile
	- mention the parts of agile that is being used


- objectives isn't just features of software
-  testing a part of objective
	- background research
	- lit review
