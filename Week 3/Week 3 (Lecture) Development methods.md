# Development methods

## Learning Objectives
- What is a project for?
- What is a development method?
- How can I improve my grade by choosing the right method?

## What is the Project For?
- BCS, Chartered Institute for IT Guidelines
	- The ability to deploy appropriate theory, practices and tools for the specification, design, implementation and evaluation of computer-based systems
	- The ability to specify, design or construct computer- based systems
	- The ability to evaluate systems in terms of general quality attributes and possible trade-offs presented within the given problem

## What is a method?
- Method: a repeatable and systematic process for creating some artefact
- Justification for using a particular method is needed
- Purposes of method
	- Maximise productivity (for resources available: YOU!)
	- Minimise risk

## Iterative & Incremental

## What about Agile?
- Agile ceremonies not needed for individual project
	- Stand-up meetings
- Agile ceremonies that might be useful
	- Sprint planning
	- Retrospectives
	- Customer demo (to supervisor)


## Project Gantt Chart
- Overall project timeline (adapt to your situation) Project Gantt Chart

## Minimum Viable Product???
- Product with just enough features to satisfy \[supervisors], and to provide feedback for future product development
- Skeleton product with end-to-end functionality
- Essence of intended solution
- Eric Reis. (2011). The Lean Startup: How Constant Innovation Creates Radically Successful Businesses. London: Portfolio Penguin.


## Requirements
- Outline requirements for whole system
- Detailed requirements for current increment
- User stories
	- As a \[user], I want to \[perform operation] in order to \[achieve outcome]
- Use Cases
	- User interaction scenarios


## Use Case Template (example)

| Use Case Title        | \[Title corresponds to use case diagram] |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Primary Actor         | \[Actor corresponds to use case diagram] |
| Goal                  |                                         |
| Scope                 |                                         |
| Preconditions         |                                         |
| Postconditions        |                                         |
| Main Success Scenario | 1. 2. 3. ...                            |
| Extensions            | 2a. 3a. ...                             |


## Prioritisation
- There are always more features than resources available to build them. Always!
- MoSCoW prioritisation
	- Must Have (minimum viable product)
	- Should have (version 1, \[and version 2])
	- Could have (version 2)
	- Won’t have (manage scope by eliminating features)


## Architecture Styles
- Multi-channel
	- Support mobile AND desktop clients
- Service oriented
	- RESTful services; browser-based UI
	- Microservices
- Pipe and Filter
	- Compilers, language translators, dataflow driven
- Modelling and simulation
	- Model building, parameterisation and evaluation
- Experimental Harness
	- Machine learning, data input, dashboard, metrics

## Software Design Patterns
- Model, view, controller
- Persistence layer (object to relational?)
- Object creation factories?

## Implementation Choices
- Implementation technologies
	- Languages
	- Frameworks
	- Game engines
	- Simulation tools
- How to choose?
	- Experiments?
	- Research literature?
	- Case studies?

## Implementation Choices
- Conduct a “mini-experiment” to compare alternative approaches
- Make thoughtful choices
- Record assumptions and decisions
- Reflect on decisions in project report

## Evaluate what you have built
- Unit testing (of course!)
	- Methods, parameter passing, variable initialisation…
- Acceptance testing
	- Does it do what it is supposed to do?
- User interface testing
	- Usability
	- Classmates evaluate UI and provide (constructive) feedback
	- “Oh, its wonderful!” is useless feedback

## Evaluate what you have built
- Integration testing
	- Does the front-end work with the back-end
- Regression testing
	- Test increment 1 after you add increment 2
- Load testing
	- How is the system performance?
	- How is the system performance with a sensible number of users?

## Deploy
- Cloud deployment
	- Data stores
	- Web services
	- AWS, Digital Ocean
- Continuous integration?
	- Build tools that also deploy to server
	- Push to github triggers copy to web server

## Summary
- A Development Method helps you achieve your research goals
	- Maximise productivity
	- Minimise risk of project failure
- I recommend an iterative and incremental approach
	- This obviously works if you are doing a design and build type project
	- This also works if you are creating a simulation, algorithm or conceptual model
- Get benchmark algorithm working (MVP)
- Enhanced algorithm or better metric (increment 2)
- Refinements and experimental comparison with benchmark (increment 3)

## Questions for your project
- Have you chosen a method, yet?
	- How will your method minimise risk (of project failure)
	- How will your method allow you to review progress during the project?
- Setup a WhatsApp FYP study group: Talk to the group members about…
	- What does a minimum viable product mean for your project?
- E.g. a simplified working simulation model or conceptual model
- What are the key features of your MVP?
- How detailed should our methodology be
	- And how should we report this
- In your logbook
- Then your report
