# Development methods
Project Development Methods
Learning Objectives
• What is a project for?
• What is a development method?
• How can I improve my grade by choosing the
right method?
2
• BCS, Chartered Institute for IT Guidelines
– The ability to deploy appropriate theory, practices and
tools for the specification, design, implementation
and evaluation of computer-based systems
– The ability to specify, design or construct computer-
based systems
– The ability to evaluate systems in terms of general
quality attributes and possible trade-offs presented
within the given problem
What is the Project For?
3
• Method: a repeatable and systematic process
for creating some artefact
• Justification for using a particular method is
needed
• Purposes of method
– Maximise productivity (for resources available: YOU!)
– Minimise risk
What is a method?

• Agile ceremonies not needed for individual
project
– Stand-up meetings
• Agile ceremonies that might be useful
– Sprint planning
– Retrospectives
– Customer demo (to supervisor)
What about Agile?

• Product with just enough features to satisfy
[supervisors], and to provide feedback for future
product development
• Skeleton product with end-to-end functionality
• Essence of intended solution

REQUIREMENTS
• Outline requirements for whole system
• Detailed requirements for current increment
• User stories
– As a [user], I want to [perform operation] in order to
[achieve outcome]
• Use Cases
– User interaction scenarios

15
• There are always more features than resources
available to build them. Always!
• MoSCoW prioritisation
– Must Have (minimum viable product)
– Should have (version 1, [and version 2])
– Could have (version 2)
– Won’t have (manage scope by eliminating features)
Prioritisation
16
DESIGN
• Multi-channel
– Support mobile AND desktop clients
• Service oriented
– RESTful services; browser-based UI
– Microservices
• Pipe and Filter
– Compilers, language translators, dataflow driven
• Modelling and simulation
– Model building, parameterisation and evaluation
• Experimental Harness
– Machine learning, data input, dashboard, metrics
Architecture Styles
18
• Model, view, controller
• Persistence layer (object to relational?)
• Object creation factories?
Software Design Patterns
19
BUILD
• Implementation technologies
– Languages
– Frameworks
– Game engines
– Simulation tools
• How to choose?
– Experiments?
– Research literature?
– Case studies?
Implementation Choices
21
• Conduct a “mini-experiment” to compare
alternative approaches
• Make thoughtful choices
• Record assumptions and decisions
• Reflect on decisions in project report
Implementation Choices
22
TEST
• Unit testing (of course!)
– Methods, parameter passing, variable initialisation…
• Acceptance testing
– Does it do what it is supposed to do?
• User interface testing
– Usability
– Classmates evaluate UI and provide (constructive)
feedback
– “Oh, its wonderful!” is useless feedback
Evaluate what you have built
24
• Integration testing
– Does the front-end work with the back-end
• Regression testing
– Test increment 1 after you add increment 2
• Load testing
– How is the system performance?
– How is the system performance with a sensible
number of users?
Evaluate what you have built
25
DEPLOY
• Cloud deployment
– Data stores
– Web services
– AWS, Digital Ocean
• Continuous integration?
– Build tools that also deploy to server
– Push to github triggers copy to web server
Deploy

• A Development Method helps you achieve your research
goals
– Maximise productivity
– Minimise risk of project failure
• I recommend an iterative and incremental approach
– This obviously works if you are doing a design and build type
project
– This also works if you are creating a simulation, algorithm or
conceptual model
• Get benchmark algorithm working (MVP)
• Enhanced algorithm or better metric (increment 2)
• Refinements and experimental comparison with benchmark (increment 3)
Summary
30
• Have you chosen a method, yet?
– How will your method minimise risk (of project failure)
– How will your method allow you to review progress during the
project?
• Setup a WhatsApp FYP study group: Talk to the group
members about…
– What does a minimum viable product mean for your project?
• E.g. a simplified working simulation model or conceptual model
• What are the key features of your MVP?
• How detailed should our methodology be
– And how should we report this
• In your logbook
• Then your report
