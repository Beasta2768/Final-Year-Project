# Requirements Engineering

## Why is is important to us?

## Summary ?
• Talk, talk, talk, to the people who want and will use the software
• Understand exactly what needs to be built
• Don’t be over ambitious (features)
• Go back and talk again, keep them in the loop
• Test the software with them

## What Can Go Wrong?

• From an end user perspective
	• What system? I haven’t seen a new system (Vapourware, 25%)
	• It might work, but it is dreadful to use!
	• Its pretty – but does it do anything useful?
• From a client perspective
	• If I’d know the real price, I’d never have agreed
	• It’s no use delivering it now – we needed it last April!
	• It works but the installation was such a mess!
	• I didn’t want it in the first place
	• Everything has changed now- we need a completely different system

## User Requirements
• Need to understand how the organization or user operates at present
• What are the problems with the current system?
• What are the requirements users have of a new system that are not in the current system?

## Current System
• Much of the current system meets the needs of people who use it
• Sections of the system no longer meet the needs of the organization
• Some aspects of the organization’s work are not covered by the current system
• The system can no longer evolve but needs to be replaced

• It is important to understand current system to carry functionality forward into new system
• It is also important to understand it so that shortcomings and defects can be corrected in the new system

## Reasons for Investigating the Current System
• Functionality is required in new system
• Data must be migrated into new system
• Technical documentation provides details of processing algorithms
• Defects of existing system must be avoided
• Parts of existing system may have to be kept
• We need to understand the work of the users
• Baseline information about the existing system helps set targets for the new one

## New Requirements
• Organizations operate in a rapidly changing business environment
• Organizations operate in a changing technical environment
• Governments and supra-governmental organizations introduce legislation
• Organizations merge, demerge, take over and get taken over
• All this drives the need to replace systems and build new ones

## Types of Requirements
• Functional
• Non-functional
• Usability

## Functional Requirements
• Describe what a system must do
• Include:
• processes
• interfaces with users and other systems
• what the system must hold data about
• Modelled with Use Case Diagrams, Task
Analysis. Later will be modelled with other
kinds of diagrams that show the structure of the
system (Class Diagrams) and its behaviour

Non-functional Requirements
• Concerned with how well the system performs
• Include:
• response times
• volumes of data
• security considerations
• Documented in Requirements List or in Use
Case Model (for requirements that can be
linked to specific use cases)

Usability Requirements
• Concerned with matching the system to the
way that people work
• Sets measurable objectives
• Include:
• characteristics of users
• tasks users undertake
• Documented in
Requirements List.
Tested by Prototypes,
paper, lo-fi, hi-fi, working system

Fact Finding Techniques
• Background Reading
• Interviewing
• Observation
• Document Sampling
• Questionnaires

User Involvement
• A variety of stakeholders:
• senior management—with overall responsibility for
the organization
• financial managers—who control budgets
• managers of user departments
• representatives of users of the system
