Why is is important to us?
Lee Griffiths 3
Summary ?
• Talk, talk, talk, to the people who want and will
use the software
• Understand exactly what needs to be built
• Don’t be over ambitious (features)
• Go back and talk again, keep them in the loop
• Test the software with them

What Can Go Wrong?
01/11/2024 Lee Griffiths 8
• From an end user perspective
• What system? I haven’t seen a new system (Vapourware, 25%)
• It might work, but it is dreadful to use!
• Its pretty – but does it do anything useful?
• From a client perspective
• If I’d know the real price, I’d never have agreed
• It’s no use delivering it now – we needed it last April!
• It works but the installation was such a mess!
• I didn’t want it in the first place
• Everything has changed now- we need a completely different
system

User Requirements
• Need to understand how the organization or
user operates at present
• What are the problems with the current
system?
• What are the requirements
users have of a new
system that are not in
the current system?
Lee Griffiths 10
Current System
• Much of the current system meets the needs of
people who use it
• Sections of the system no longer meet the
needs of the organization
• Some aspects of the organization’s work are
not covered by the current system
• The system can no longer evolve but needs to
be replaced
Lee Griffiths 11
Current System
• It is important to understand current system to
carry functionality forward into new system
• It is also important to understand it so that
shortcomings and defects can be corrected in
the new system
Lee Griffiths 12
Reasons for Investigating
the Current System
• Functionality is required in new system
• Data must be migrated into new system
• Technical documentation provides details of
processing algorithms
• Defects of existing system must be avoided
• Parts of existing system may have to be kept
• We need to understand the work of the users
• Baseline information about the existing system
helps set targets for the new one
Lee Griffiths 13
New Requirements
• Organizations operate in a rapidly changing
business environment
• Organizations operate in a changing technical
environment
• Governments and supra-governmental
organizations introduce legislation
• Organizations merge, demerge, take over and
get taken over
• All this drives the need to replace systems and
build new ones

Types of Requirements
• Functional
• Non-functional
• Usability
Lee Griffiths 16
Functional Requirements
• Describe what a system must do
• Include:
• processes
• interfaces with users and other systems
• what the system must hold data about
• Modelled with Use Case Diagrams, Task
Analysis. Later will be modelled with other
kinds of diagrams that show the structure of the
system (Class Diagrams) and its behaviour
Lee Griffiths 17
Non-functional Requirements
• Concerned with how well the system performs
• Include:
• response times
• volumes of data
• security considerations
• Documented in Requirements List or in Use
Case Model (for requirements that can be
linked to specific use cases)
Lee Griffiths 18
Usability Requirements
• Concerned with matching the system to the
way that people work
• Sets measurable objectives
• Include:
• characteristics of users
• tasks users undertake
• Documented in
Requirements List.

Fact Finding Techniques
• Background Reading
• Interviewing
• Observation
• Document Sampling
• Questionnaires

User Involvement
• A variety of stakeholders:
• senior management—with overall responsibility for
the organization
• financial managers—who control budgets
• managers of user departments
• representatives of users of the system
