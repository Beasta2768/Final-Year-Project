### Methods for generating collages
>Zhang, M., Li, M., Yu, J., & Chen, L. (2023). Aesthetic Photo Collage With Deep Reinforcement Learning. _IEEE Transactions on Multimedia_, _25_, 4653â€“4664. https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2022.3180217
1. Content-preserving collages involve arranging photos without cropping or occlusion, using techniques such as :
	- Tree-based page division
	- Voronoi tree mapping
	- Photo layout methods focused on scaling and translation

2. Non-content-preserving collages use several approaches:
	- Region-partitioning methods using Voronoi tessellation, circle packing, and feature embedding
	- Customized energy terms optimization methods
	- Methods focusing on seamless blending and spatial efficiency

3. Specific implementations include
	- AutoCollage: Creates collages of representative elements using optimization steps
	- Circle Packing Collage: Partitions canvas based on regions of interest
	- Picture Collage: Uses handcrafted energy terms and Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization
