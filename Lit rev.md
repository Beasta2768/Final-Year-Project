### Methods for generating collages
>Zhang, M., Li, M., Yu, J., & Chen, L. (2023). Aesthetic Photo Collage With Deep Reinforcement Learning. _IEEE Transactions on Multimedia_, _25_, 4653–4664. https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2022.3180217
1. Content-preserving collages involve arranging photos without cropping or occlusion, using techniques such as :
	- Tree-based page division
	- Voronoi tree mapping
	- Photo layout methods focused on scaling and translation

2. Non-content-preserving collages use several approaches:
	- Region-partitioning methods using Voronoi tessellation, circle packing, and feature embedding
	- Customized energy terms optimization methods
	- Methods focusing on seamless blending and spatial efficiency

3. Specific implementations include
	- AutoCollage: Creates collages of representative elements using optimization steps
	- Circle Packing Collage: Partitions canvas based on regions of interest
	- Picture Collage: Uses handcrafted energy terms and Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization

### Adapting for mobile
>Murugesan, S., & Venkatakrishnan, B. A. (2005). Addressing the challenges of Web applications on mobile handheld devices. _4th Annual International Conference on Mobile Business, ICMB 2005_, 199–205. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMB.2005.16
1. Manual Reauthoring: Web authors manually prepare multiple versions of a web page for different types of handheld devices. While this produces well-tailored pages, it is time-consuming and impractical for large numbers of pages or dynamically generated content 

2. Automatic Reauthoring: This uses transcoding modules to automatically convert pages using:
    - DOM APIs and XSLT to generate WML and HTML content
	- Tag replacement for unsupported browser elements.

3. Page Block Method: This technique:
	- Analyzes the web page structure
	- Splits content into smaller, logically related units
	- Creates thumbnail representations at the top level
	- Provides detailed information in sub-pages.

4. Thumbnail View: This approach:
	- Presents pages as "graphical summaries"
	- Allows users to see overall context in a resizable thumbnail
	- Enables zooming into specific parts without scrolling
	- Works well for familiar websites.

5. Directory Presentation: This uses:
	- A middleware proxy navigation engine
	- Concise display of URL link structure
	- Data detectors to extract useful information like phone numbers and addresses.

6. Structure-aware Presentation: This method:
	- Preserves the original webpage's underlying layout
	- Groups repeated patterns
	- Creates separate links based on relative importance of components
