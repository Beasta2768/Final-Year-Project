## Introduction, Aim, Motivation and Background
The project aims to help people protect and improve their wellbeing, especially during
challenging times like pandemic through a responsive application developed by using the
Flutter development kit, Dart language and SQLite databases. More and more people required
to self-isolate due to coronavirus. This situation left most of us feeling lonesome and
unmotivated to work remotely or achieve daily tasks productively. By using this app, people
will improve their concentration, presence and productivity. Moreover, people will be more
peaceful, which will enhance their work and social lives and interactions with others.
While there are many applications around mindfulness theme such as Calm, Headspace and
Breathe [5], I couldn’t find an application which is responsive enough to provide features such
as adjustable font size or colour schemes for people with colour blindness. Most of the apps
are not free and doesn’t have a user guide.
According to the Health Foundation, 69% of adults reported feeling worried about the effect
of COVID-19. Moreover, 63% of the adults worried about the future and 56% feeling stressed
and anxious due to financial loss and loss of coping mechanisms such as exercise, friends, family
members and hobbies. [4] My motivation behind developing a mindfulness app is to be able
to reach and help a large number of people who suffers from these problems and create them
a safe space to breathe and reflect on their emotions mindfully. Moreover, my passion and
enthusiasm on the subject will help me to think about innovations to help people get through
these challenging times.
Last summer, I built myself an android to-do list app using Kotlin language and Android studio
out of interest, and I enjoyed it. In this final year project, I wanted to challenge myself by
learning Flutter and Dart language to build a native cross-platform app with an SQLite
database. Even though Flutter is a new software development kit, and not very commonly used
as React Native, it has a variety of advantages such as providing faster performance and hot
reload function. [3] Another reason for me choosing this project to show my passion for learning new technologies in the industry and improve myself. As Flutter and dart seem very
unfamiliar to me, I want to use all of my abilities to push my limits and create an application which will be beneficial not only for me but for everyone at the end.
## Customers
The mobile app is for teenagers, young-adult and adults who want to improve their ability to be mindful and focus on the moment with the calming music, sounds and journaling section which they can acknowledge their emotions, mood and gratitude.
## Objectives
Objective 1 Design the pages of the app using Fluid UI.
Objective 2 Implement the user login and sign-in page and store the user to the database.
Objective 3 Implement the welcome page with background music and navigation menu.
Objective 4 Implement the journaling and mindful breathing meditation pages. Objective 5
Do unit, widget and integrational level testing using Flutter features and test classes.
Objective 6 Do the user testing by using Google Play Store and App Store beta testing option.
Objective 7 Deploy the application to the App Store and Goggle Play Store using XCode and Android studio.
### Optional Objectives
Objective 1 Migrate the mobile app to the web app using Flutter extension.
## Development Requirements
I will develop the app using the MacBook Pro laptop (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015. It has 2,2 GHz
Quad-Core Intel Core i7 CPU processor and runs the macOS Catalina version 10.15.7 which is
the latest release of macOS operating system.
The primary development environment is going to be Android Studio version 4.0 with Flutter
and Dart plugins installed from the marketplace. It is an Integrated Development Environment
which is used for developing Android apps 
However, for testing and deployment purposes, XCode 12.0.01 version will be used, which is a
software development environment to develop software for macOS, IOS products. IOS emulator that comes with Flutter and Open android Emulator Android Accelerated Oreo
and Pixel XL API 30 will be used for testing purposes in the development stage. Emulators
create virtual devices on the screen. It is easier to test the program while developing to see the
functionality and the design.
SQLite database engine latest version 3.33.0 will be used to store users. It is one of the most
commonly used databases and implements a serverless, transactional and self-contained
database engine.

## Methodology
The agile methodology will be used as the methodology of the project. Agile methodology is
incremental and iterative, more open for changes during the development period according to
customer requirements, and its iterative model will be beneficial for meeting the needs of the
customer. Since I don’t have lots of experience in Flutter environment as well as the dart
language, it will allow me to make changes easier when something goes wrong compared to
other development methodologies such as Waterfall.
PXP (Personal Extreme Programming) methodology would not be beneficial for the project
since I won’t be able to do the pair programming process and the designing of the application
is as important as the software functionality, the design shouldn’t be simple.
Kanban methodology is open for changes more than SCRUM. However, it does not contain
iterations which will make it hard for me to do the demo to supervisors and get their ideas. By
using SCRUM with Agile methodology, I will be able to divide the work into sprints and at the
end of each one, receive feedback to produce a high-quality end product. Moreover, sprint
planning, prioritising the tasks and sprint retrospectives will be useful for me on analysing the
objectives and thinking about what worked well or didn’t go as planned.
I will plan the project using the Gantt Chart, Product and Sprint backlogs, decide on the
requirements using user stories, use cases and UI prototyping, which will give me the idea of
the design of the app as well as the further functionality additions. The project is a mobile-native cross-platform app. However, as an optional objective, it might become a multi-
channelled app. Dart programming language will be used as a primary language of Flutter using
Android Studio and XCode development environments with the help of the SQLite database. I
will use different Android and IOS emulators to test the functionality and UI design in the
development stage. Moreover, I will do the unit, widget and integrational testing in each sprint.
At the end of the third sprint, the app will be realised to Google Play Store and Apple Store for
beta testing for users, and then I will finally publish it.
