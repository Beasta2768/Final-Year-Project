# Research Methodology

## Learning Objective
• What is research methodology
• Choosing an appropriate methodology

## What is methodology
• Methods: a research tool, a component of research
• Methodology: the justification for using a particular research methods in pursuit of the research aim.
	– The general research strategy that outlines the way in which research is to be undertaken

## Contextual view
• Method describes how you will collect data, conduct experiment, etc
• Methodology is broader strategy of how you apply a set of methods to support or reject research hypothesis
• Industry practitioners are (generally) more focused on methods. Academic perspective is more about framing the methods within a methodology that justifies the goals of the research



## A good methodology
• Robust
	– The methodology can justify and evidence the choice of methods and logical combination of these against the aim, objectives, research questions and hypothesis of the research
• Reliable
	– For any similar problem the application of the methodology will produce consistent and comparable outcomes
• Repeatable (Reproduction (results) / Replication (Phenomenon)
	– Anyone following the defined methodology, from the same starting point, should be able to repeat the outcomes of the research undertaken

## Computer Science
• Characterised as an Empirical Discipline
	– Each new programme is seen as an experiment
• Structure and behaviour can be studied
	– Studies issues from a technical perspective
• Numerical Analysis
• Data Structures and Algorithms
• Data storage and manipulation
• Relationships between different pieces of software, hardware
• Tools and techniques for developing software


## Information Systems
• Very closely related to Computer Science
	– Concerned with the interaction with Social and Technical Issues
	– The link between people (individuals, groups and organisations) and the hardware, software and data aspects of information technology
	– Studies issues from a human perspective
• User interfaces (UX)
• Matching to high level aim
• Evaluation of impact

## In Essence
• In CS/IS we are using a series of experiments to develop a technical solution and demonstrate that this meets the intended outcome defined by the aim.
	– This is inherently a positivist view
• We are seeking to prove something
• Methods define the experiments
	– And need to be selected appropriately to evaluate the work against the intended outcomes
• Methodology determines that this is the ‘right’ research and that the result(s) is valid
	– Robust, Reliable & Repeatable

## Methods
• Experimental
	– Definition of approaches to extract results from real world implementations
• EG: Development of new social network
	– Technical issues assessed by benchmarks (availability, reliability, scalability, stability, performance, ….)
	– Social (Societal) issues such as usability and evaluation against problem domain assessed with users
		» Questionnaires, focus groups, ….
• Simulation
	– Approaches that investigate systems and principles outside of experimental domain
• EG: Development of new algorithms
	– Predominantly technical evaluation
		» Simulation environment for matching of contextual system
		» Quantitative evaluation of algorithm within the simulation systems

• Theoretical
	– Classical methodologies around the formulation of conceptual and formal models
• EG: Development of new concepts for sorting data
	– Logical and mathematical evaluation of theory (iteration, recursion, induction, …)
	– May also require application of other methods (Experimentation, simulation,..) to prove efficiency of new ideas (e.g. performance)
• Social
– Exploration of evidence to develop new understanding
• EG: Extensive evaluation of published works to determine effectiveness of a
development methodology or technique
– Literature survey and critical evaluation
– Empirical studies of groups of practitioners (questionnaires, focus groups, etc).
– Case studies
Methods
A framework for computing
research methods
What do we want to achieve?
• Find out what is happening
• Develop something that works
• Evaluate an existing system, technology or
technique
• Compare existing systems
• Change Human Behaviour
Have we achieved our goals?
• Draw Conclusions
• Evaluate Results
• Identify Limitations
Where does the data come from?
• How to collect?
• Read, Observe, Ask, Measure, Experiment,
Model
• Where to Collect?
• Field, Lab, Conceptual
• What to collect?
• Quantitative
• Speed, scalability, performance
• Qualitative
• Experience, acceptance, use, literature
What do we do with the Data?
• Identify themes, patterns, quotes…
• Calculate Numbers
• Identify Trends
• Express (via multimedia)
• Create frameworks/taxonomies
• Developing a framework for research identifies
– Aim
• One only
• Grounded in the problem domain
• Focused on the (human) issue the work is seeking to address
– Objectives
• Progressive, measurable decomposition of the activities that
address the aim
– Research Questions
• What are the key aspects of the work that need to be resolved
– Hypotheses
• Specific aspects of the work that need to be tested
• Appropriate methods are chosen to validate these
Development of methodology
• Explanation of:
– How Objectives, Research Questions and
Hypotheses have been developed
• And exploration of how these will address the problem
defined by the aim
– Validation of the methods chosen against the specific
O, RQ & H
– Explanation of how this methodology will Robustly,
Reliably and Repeatedly enact the research to meet
the aim.
– Definition of the boundaries of the research
Therefore: Methodology
• This is the guiding strategy for your research
– Define it before you start
• Introduction: Following Aim and Objectives define the Methodology
– RQ, H and Methods
• Discussion: Critically evaluate your Methodology
– Did it work?
– Problems and issues
• Have you had to change it (and why)
– How would you improve it
Methodology: Where does it
fit
• Follow your methodology
– But let the research lead you – if it needs to change revise it
• And discuss this later
• The research methodology is not the same as the development
methodology
– Julian discussed that
• Whether the ‘product’ succeeds or fails is equally valid
– Provided you have developed a ‘good’ methodology and have followed it
Methodology: Key things to
note
EXAMPLE: METHODOLOGY
What does ‘good’ look like
• Sought to combine multiple video streams, in
realtime, to create low latency, high quality
representations of people in virtual reality
applications.
– Mostly theory based research
• How to create real-time 3D forms without tessellation
– Simulation was chosen to test and evaluate principles
• Quantitative studies of performance (speed) and quality.
Visual, Spatial and Temporal Quality in Video-
Based Reconstruction of People: Achieving,
Prototyping and Evaluating
• Aim: To improve on the temporal and visual quality of 3D video based
reconstruction through new approaches to developing, doing and
measuring it.
– Led to core research questions
• Theory: new concepts and models (developing)
• Technical: experiments to test principles
• Simulation: how to measure results
• Objectives
– O1: Develop novel approaches to holistically measure the balance of visual,
spatial and temporal qualities of video based reconstruction while balancing key
impacting factors
– O2: Develop a novel reconstruction/rendering technique that improves upon the
balance of visual, spatial and temporal qualities in video based reconstruction.
– O3: Assess the novel technique for improving the balance of qualities by
applying novel approaches to measure holistic performance.
Aim and Objectives
• Research Questions
– Q1: Can a technological environment be formalised and established that enables
experimentation and rapid prototyping through reliable, repeatable objective analysis.
– Q2: What algorithmic structure should a reconstruction/rendering process take to align with
features of programmable graphics pipelines to utilise the available processing resource
effectively
– Q3: What quantifiable measurements should be made to establish confidence in matching
evolving techniques for reconstruction to current state of the art
• Hypotheses
– H1: Simulation of the capture and reconstruction pipeline enables understanding of the
impact of data capture configuration on resultant reconstructed form
– H2: An integrated reconstruction and rendering technique is possible within the features and
functionality of the programmable graphics pipeline
– H3: Simulation of the capture and reconstruction pipeline enables repeatable objective
analysis for the development of technique
Research Questions and
Hypotheses
Research Strategy
Naive Approach
Informed Approach
Refined Approach
I know best and can do it without looking at what
anyone else has done
• Failed miserably
• But, told me what the real problems were and what
questions I really needed to answer
Apply knowledge and understanding from previous
attempt with research into the problems identified
• Gave a working system (quality) but very slow
performance
Through development of theory, and testing by
simulation address the specific issues affecting both
quality and performance
• Defined experiments
• Implied a simulation driven, iterative approach

• This is research – Methodology is important
– Strategic approach to how you will undertake the project
– Grounded in the Problem Domain
• And mapping route to your solution space
– It is how you validate your project
• How you know the answer to reach is the right answer
• How you demonstrate a successful project achieves its goals
– And others can repeat this
• How you understand where unsuccessful projects have failed
– And stops others from needing to undertake the same research
– Everyone (in a group) will have a different methodology
• But are likely to use similar methods and general approaches
