## What is Research?
- “The deliberate study of other people for the purposes of increasing understanding and/or adding to knowledge” (Dawson, 2002)
- Refers to a set of assumptions and methods used to find answers to questions and to advance knowledge.
- As a student you are expected to look at things much more critically and more deeply.
- Academic projects require some form of evidence and contextualisation.

## Expectations from Students
- Develop your own thoughts, arguments, ideas and concepts.
- Question things and look at things in new ways and new angles.
- You are expected to think!
- This deeper understanding of situations, problems and events is supported by your research skills.
## Why a Final Year Project
- Assessment across a number of modules simultaneously.
- Allows you to develop new skills.
- Work independently.
- You are given the opportunity to make a contribution.
- There are no limits!

## The Research Process
- Review the Field.
	- What is the state of the art?
- Build a theory/hypothesis
	- deduction from literature, supervisor’s idea, personal experience, brainstorming, inspiration
- Test the theory/hypothesis
	- data collection, analysis, results
- Reflection and integration
	- Evaluation, “contribution to knowledge”

## Research Motivation
- The research process requires a high degree of motivation from the researcher …
- …. and it often helps if you understand your reasons for doing the research:
	- where are you coming from?
	- what are you trying to achieve?
	- where are you intending to get to afterwards?
	- do you want to change the world, or change your world?
	- are you a pragmatist or an idealist?

## Computing Projects
- Computing projects come in all different shapes and sizes.
- Computing (academic) projects need to do more than a piece of software.
- It should:
	- Involve an element of research
	- Justify its context
	- Evaluate and discuss its results.

## Project Management
- The importance of planning should be the rule
for every stage of the project if the project is to be successful
- Failing to plan is planning for failure
- SMART (Specific, Measurable, Appropriate,Realistic, Timely) Objectives
- Tasks, Deliverables, Milestones, Gantt Chart

## Literature Review
- Literature Review acts as an introduction to your project.
- It justify your project
- It sets your project within context by discussing and critically evaluating past and current research
- It provides other researchers with a starting point from which they can understand how your project evolved.

## What is it?
- A list of description and key words from journal articles, conference papers, books
- The act of searching for and identifying information relevant to a research project
- A survey of past, present and future writings and research relevant to a research project
- A literature review is an account of what has been published on a topic by accredited scholars and researchers.
- Its purpose is to convey to the reader what knowledge and ideas have been established on a topic, and what their strengths and weaknesses are.

## Why do it?
- Confidence
	- that you are knowledgeable about your research area and your theory/hypotheses
- the theory/hypothesis is original and will be valued by your peer community
- Educational
- you can learn about other researchers’ approaches to their research issues, their methodologies and writing techniques
- you can learn more about your research area, allowing you to appreciate and build on the work of earlier researchers

## Literature Review – how to start?
- As with the others stages of the research project, the Literature Review should be well-planned, systemic and thorough:-
- identify the key concepts, and then the words and phrases (and alternative terms) that are most representative, being careful with spellings
- make yourself aware of the search facilities available: library, internet
- use as wide a range of information sources as possible: supervisor, internet, books, journals, conferences, reports, theses
- read, critically assess, and then record details of any information that you think is relevant to your project for later use

## Where to find information
- Library
- Journals/ Conference proceedings
- WWW
- ACM/IEEE digital libraries
- Google scholar (http://scholar.google.com/)
- Scientific Literature Digital Library (CiteSeet.IST) http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/
- Authors websites/ contact authors.

## Literature Review – recording
-  For each piece of information make an index card (paper or electronic) containing:
	- Title
	- Authors
	- Full correctly formatted reference
	- Keywords
	- Brief summary of the reference (2-3 sentences only on each of the following)
		- Aims/objectives
		- Data used, if relevant
		- Methodology/Techniques used
		- Results/Conclusions
		- Likely relevance to your project
