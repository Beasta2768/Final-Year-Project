• Composition
• Introduction
• Literature Review
• Methods

## Approaches to writing
• Top down
	– Headings, then sub-headings, then sub-sub-headings
	– Expand sub-sub-headings into paragraphs
• Paragraphs are the unit of composition
• Bottom up
	– Free writing
	– Brain dump all your thoughts on a topic
	– Then edit and correct
	– Organise your writing into logical structure
	– Add new material to fill in gaps

## Edit your own writing
• Never, ever hand in a first draft. NEVER
• Organise your writing into logical structure
• Use spell checker
• Use grammar checker but with care
• Technical writing should clear and simple
• Clear writing is evidence of clear thinking
• Remove needless words
• Use active voice

## Sentences
- Best
	• Keep sentences short
	• Keep sentences simple
	• Use positive language
	• Omit needless words
- Worst
	• Avoid long sentences, that have clauses and sub clauses in them
	• Avoid complex sentences
	• Don’t use negative language
	• Avoid lots and lots of unnecessary words
- Composition, William Strunk https://www.bartleby.com/141/


## Paragraphs
• Paragraphs are the unit of composition
• Start with a topic sentence
• Topic sentence tells reader main idea in
paragraph
• Use following sentences to expand on main idea
• A summary sentence at the end of the paragraphs helps transition to the next

• Example
	– Paragraphs are the unit of composition in technical writing. A paragraph should address only one topic. The paragraph should be around 4-6 sentences long. Paragraphs can be moved around within a longer text to create a logical flow. Paragraphs are a very useful tool in technical writing
• Topic sentence at start
• Explanatory sentences in the middle
• Summary sentence at end

• Bad example
	– Java is a good example of a modern programming language. Simula is a object oriented programming language. C++ is a strongly typed language. I have chosen Python for my project.
• Better example
	– Java is a good example of a modern programming language. Java is an object-oriented programming language. Java is a strongly typed language. I have chosen Java for my project.


## Report Introduction
• Provide a bit of context
• Motivation for project
• Summarise key findings and main messages
• Summary of report structure
• Refer to project guide
• Refer to grading grid

• Motivation
	– Why is the topic important?
• What is the problem?
• Supporting evidence (articles, statistics, Govt. reports)
	– Why is the topic important to you?
• What inspired your interest in the project?
• Do you have a personal connection to the project?
	– Are you particularly interested in the technologies involved?
• Why are these technologies important? Evidence?

### Motivation
• Weak
	– I am interested in ransomware prevention. I think this is an important topic and there are job opportunities in this area.
• Better
	– Ransomware attacks have increased by x00% in 5 years \[GCHQ, 2021]. Ransomware attacks have resulted in over US $yB in losses, since \[NSA, 2023].
• Weak
	– I want to build a game because Unity 3D is easy to use and I got as good mark for assignment last semester.

• Better
	– I was close to my grandmother. Before she died, my grandmother was a dementia sufferer. As her condition worsened she had many challenges with daily tasks around the home. My project i designed to support dementia sufferers with living at home.
	
## Report Introduction
• What are the most important elements of the project
• Summarise the most important things you hope to achieve
• Provide an overview of the report
	– List the sections
	– Provide a brief (one or two sentence) summary of each section


## Literature Review
• Think of flow like a funnel
• Start with broad, general, topics
• Move toward specific issues of your project
![[Pasted image 20241102101613.png]]

• Start with broad sources
	– Text books
	– Lecture materials
	– Overview articles, survey articles
• Move towards more specific sources
	– Research journal articles
• Focus on topics closely related to project
	– Conference papers more focused on topics in your project
	– More specific, more technical sources

• In research
	– Literature review is used to show a gap in knowledge
	– Identify a gap your project is going to fill
	– Show work that others have done, around your project

## Methods
![[Pasted image 20241102101626.png]]
### Methodology
• Choose methods to suite type of project
![[Pasted image 20241102101643.png]]

Method
• Iterative and incremental
• Overall project timeline (adapt to your situation)
Christmas
Break
Date???

Minimum
Viable
Product
Version 1
Version 2
• “Science” project
– Evaluate alternative ways to solve problem
– Advantages and disadvantages of different
approaches
• Design and build project
– Integrate mini-experiments into “normal” lifecycle
– Evaluate design and implementation choices
• Modelling projects
– Build a model, verify assumptions and evaluate

Resources
• Think of paragraphs like classes
– 4-6 sentences
– High cohesion
• Focus on just one thing in each paragraph
– Loose coupling
• A single idea should not keep coming up in adjacent paragraphs
• (Caveat) Repetition of ideas is good for emphasis in longer reports
– Use executive summary, introduction & conclusions to repeat main arguments
• Edit your own writing
– Editing and re-editing clarifies your own thinking
– Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking

Summary
• Methodology
– Approach to integrating research into project
• Development method used to create artefacts
– Iterative and incremental approach
– Minimise risk of project failure
• Think about data collection and analysis
– W here will data come from?
– How will data be analysed
