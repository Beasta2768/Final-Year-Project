## Introduction, Aim, Motivation and Background
- What the aim of the project is
	- The aim of this project is to create a photo storage/album web application that uses an image recognition artificial intelligence to automatically "tag" images based on the content of that image. Which is then used to generate collages based on those tags. 
- Who is the project for: the client and their customers
	- The  web app is for people who want their to have their own favourite pictures to be put together to remind them of moments and experiences of their past, when they would otherwise just have a collection of unorganised pictures.
- Why is the project being undertaken
	- The reason I am doing this project is because I want a photo storage web app that I can will generate collages that I could have an share with people. I want specifically an web app so I can access it from any device with an internet connection and also a phone.
- How the client and customers will benefit from the project
	- People will benefit from this by being able to upload a  curated set of images that they would want to be automatically put into a collage, allowing their favourite memories to be encapsulated in one image
- How is the student going to benefit from undertaking the project
	-  The reason I took on this project is because I wanted to develop my knowledge and skills with the react framework. This is because I already have some basic experience with react by making a react web app that interfaced with multiple API's by using promised using node.js and axios. And that project made be want to create more  developed web application with react . I also wanted to get a better understanding of service workers as my previous experience with and knowledge of service workers was shallow. I have also This project would allow me to further develop my understanding these tools.
