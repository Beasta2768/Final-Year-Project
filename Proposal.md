## Introduction, Aim, Motivation and Background
- The aim of this project is to create a photo storage/album web application that uses an image recognition artificial intelligence to automatically "tag" images based on the content of that image. Which is then used to generate collages based on those tags. 
- The  web app is for people who want their to have their own favourite pictures to be put together to remind them of moments and experiences of their past, when they would otherwise just have a collection of unorganised pictures.
- The reason I am doing this project is because I want a photo storage web app that I can will generate collages that I could have an share with people. I want specifically an web app so I can access it from any device with an internet connection and also a phone.
- People will benefit from this by being able to upload a  curated set of images that they would want to be automatically put into a collage, allowing their favourite memories to be encapsulated in one image
-  The reason I took on this project is because I wanted to develop my knowledge and skills with the react framework and add new frameworks like tailwind to my skillset. As I already have some basic experience with react by making a react web app that interfaced with multiple API's by using promised using node.js and axios, which made be want to make a more  developed web application with react . I also wanted to get a better understanding of service workers as my previous experience with and knowledge of service workers was shallow. Along with expanding on my previous existing knowledge base, I wanted to expand it too. I plan on doing this by using the tailwind CSS framework as I have only use bootstrap and pure CSS in previous projects.  This project would allow me to further develop my understanding these tools.

## Development Requirements
I will be using React and tailwind for the front end of my web app, or use bootstrap if tailwind doesn't work. For the backend I plan to use node.js with axios to integrate with database and API calls.
The main development environment I plan on using is visual studio code, it is a code editor that I am familiar with as I have used it in the past for previous react projects. Their extensions allow for easier coding using different frameworks, environments and languages, allowing me to easily use react, tailwind and node.js with axios in the same environment.

For my database to storage solution I am initially planning on using firebases cloud storage option on the spark plan. The reason I have initially went for this option is familiarity with using firebase in react as I have used it in the past with a previous react project. The spark plan is a free plan with monthly limits of 5gb if image storage, which would be about 2,500 high resolution photos, and a transfer limit of 30gb (15,000 high-res photos) and 2 million downloads and uploads. Although 2,500 high resolution images are a lot, the project is small scale and the web app is meant for a curated set of images over time. However I will be looking into other database solutions and settle on one before by the time I finish the user interface. For deploying this web app I planned on using firebase hosting due to my familiarity with it. However as with the database I will be looking into other deployment options

For tracking project progress I will be using a Trello for a Kanban board and teamgantt for a Gant chart. I am using these sites because they are free to use and I have used them before.

## Methodology
This project will be made using the agile methodology for this project. I am using agile because it's  incremental and iterative processes will allow for me to make changes during the projects development, making me able to compensate for any issues that could arise during the projects development, helping reduce risk and errors. Agile also allows me to test during different stages of development and different parts of my project. These properties of agile make it a better fit for this project than the waterfall model or would be. This is because the waterfall methodology doesn't allow for incremental testing and building and instead does all it's stages once fully before it moves onto the next stage. Resulting in design changes requiring you to re-start the process from the beginning, which would be inconvenient for a project on a smaller time scale like this (less than a year). Although I will be using the agile methodology I will not be implementing some agile methods like extreme programming as I will be doing this myself and the method is too restrictive for this project. However I will be implementing parts of scrum, product and sprint backlogs, without implementing daily scrum meetings. Instead I will be relaying project progress with my project supervisor on a weekly basis and updating my logbook and Kanban board with my projects progress. The use of scrum allows me to make use of use case diagrams/tables and user stories , helping shape the core features of the project.
