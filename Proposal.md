## Introduction, Aim, Motivation and Background
- What the aim of the project is
	- The aim of this project is to create a photo storage/album web application that uses an image recognition artificial intelligence to automatically "tag" images based on the content of that image. Which is then used to generate collages based on those tags. 
- Who is the project for: the client and their customers
	- The  web app is for people who want their to have their own favourite pictures to be put together to remind them of moments and experiences of their past, when they would otherwise just have a collection of unorganised pictures.
- Why is the project being undertaken
	- The reason I am doing this project is because I want a photo storage web app that I can will generate collages that I could have an share with people. I want specifically an web app so I can access it from any device with an internet connection and also a phone.
- How the client and customers will benefit from the project
	- People will benefit from this by being able to upload a  curated set of images that they would want to be automatically put into a collage, allowing their favourite memories to be encapsulated in one image
- How is the student going to benefit from undertaking the project
	-  The reason I took on this project is because I wanted to develop my knowledge and skills with the react framework. This is because I already have some basic experience with react by making a react web app that interfaced with multiple API's by using promised using node.js and axios. And that project made be want to create more  developed web application with react . I also wanted to get a better understanding of service workers as my previous experience with and knowledge of service workers was shallow. I have also This project would allow me to further develop my understanding these tools.

## Development Requirements
I will be using React and tailwind for the front end of my web app, or use bootstrap if tailwind doesn't work. For the backend I plan to use node.js with axios to integrate with database and API calls.
The main development environment I plan on using is visual studio code, it is a code editor that I am familiar with as I have used it in the past for previous react projects. Their extensions allow for easier coding using different frameworks, environments and languages, allowing me to easily use react, tailwind and node.js with axios in the same environment.

For my database to storage solution I am initially planning on using firebases cloud storage option on the spark plan. The reason I have initially went for this option is familiarity with using firebase in react as I have used it in the past with a previous react project. The spark plan is a free plan with monthly limits of 5gb if image storage, which would be about 2,500 high resolution photos, and a transfer limit of 30gb (15,000 high-res photos) and 2 million downloads and uploads. Although 2,500 high resolution images are a lot, the project is small scale and the web app is meant for a curated set of images over time. However I will be looking into other database solutions and settle on one before by the time I finish the user interface.

For tracking project progress I will be using a Trello for a Kanban board and teamgantt for a Gant chart. I am using these sites because they are free to use and I have used them before.

## Methodology
This project will be made using the agile methodology for this project. I am using agile because agile's  incremental and iterative processes allow for
