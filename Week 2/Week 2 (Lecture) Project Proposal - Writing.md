## Project Proposal
- An important part of any project is a proper proposal
- Reduces the risk of there being radically different expectations for the project between the student and supervisor
- Helps to keep you focused on the important goals
- Timebound objectives help you keep track of progress

### Project Proposal: Structure
- Introduction
- What are you going to research/develop?
- Who is it for? Who will benefit?
- Why are you doing this?
- How are you going to do it?
- Objectives
- Gantt Chart of objectives to show timeliness and all your deadlines
- Development requirements/ methodology
- Logbook
- Presented well and written in competent technical English

- What are you going to research/develop?
	- Overview of what is going to be researched and developed
- Who is it for?
	- Details of the customer and what they think they need
	- Details of the customer’s customers
- Who will benefit?
	- Is it your customer that will directly benefit or is it the customers/clients of the customer that you are dealing with
	- How will it benefit them?

- Why are you doing this?
	- How will this benefit you
- How are you going to do it?
	- What software and hardware is required for the project
- What development methodology are you going to use.

### Project Proposal: Who
- Aims: summary of project
- Objectives
	- Main project objectives (8-10)
	- Optional project objectives (2)
- Gantt Chart of objectives to show timeliness and all your deadlines

## Objectives
- These can be considered as what you need to do to confirm that you have achieved your Aims.
- Your objectives should use action verbs, i.e. “to ….”
- SMART objectives:
	- Specific - states exactly what you need to achieve
	- Measurable - includes a quality or quantity measure
	- Agreed - between you and your Supervisor
	- Realistic - can be challenging but must be achievable
	- Timebound - with a clear end date or timescale

- [Gantt](https://app.teamgantt.com) chart showing the timebound of the objectives
- The T of smart is Timebound
- Show how the objectives fit into trimester 1 and 2
- Remember to take into account the deadlines for the project
- Also, take into account the deadlines for other modules
- Build in some contingency/optional objective time

## Also to consider
- Methodology
	- Discusses the software and hardware requirements of the project
	- Reviews a chosen development methodology for the project

- Logbook
	- You need to keep this up to date
	- Has regular entries and gives a concise account of what has been done and ideas that you have had
	- You need to include information on lectures, seminars and tutorials that you have attended

- Presentation
	- The overall presentation of the report is appropriate
	- The report is written in competent technical English
	- Includes a word count for the project proposal

## Risk Assessment
- As part of your Learning experience, under the Health and Safety law it is a legal requirement to perform Risk Assessments on:
	- Projects
	- Industrial processes
	- Experiments
	- Hazardous jobs
- The University’s Health, Safety & Wellbeing Services Unit provide a comprehensive form for all u/g and p/g projects - you will probably only have to complete pages 1-2.
- The Risk Assessment form must be read, understood, completed and signed by:
	- yourself
	- your supervisor
and submitted by your Supervisor to the BB repository (see Project Guide), before end of week 5.

## Ethical Approval
- Also, as part of your Learning experience, you have to consider if your project requires you to seek Ethical Approval from the College Ethics committee before the project can continue
- Typical situations where this is required are:
	- Interviewing people
	- Using people as test subjects
	- Working with animals
	- Using human biological material
- The Ethical Approval Checklist form must be read, understood, completed and signed by:
	- yourself
	- your supervisor
and completed by end of week 5

## Make a Good Start
- Initially
	- read the Project Guide!
	- scope your project properly
	- prepare a realistic project proposal - identify milestones
	- allocate fixed periods of time - about 2 days a week
	- attend the weekly lectures and seminars
- During the project
	- read the Project Guide!
	- make effective use of your supervisor
	- keep your Log Book & project plan up-to-date
