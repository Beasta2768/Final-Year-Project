# Final Year Projects
##  Introduction  
- The FYP aims to give each of you an opportunity to undertake a   substantial piece of individual work and to demonstrate your   understanding of computing.  
- It is a 40 Credit Module = 1/3 of final year  
- 100% coursework and unlike previous modules, you choose the   project to suit your interests  
- 25% of marks contributing to Degree class

# Learning Materials  
- All the documents related to the FYP should be found on the   Blackboard module.  
- The Project Guide gives more details of the FYP including the   required formats of the various reports and Presentations.  
- The Supervisor Allocations file will appear in week 2.  
- The Marks Sheet page contains the marksheet, including the   assessment criteria that will be used for the different deliverables.  
	-  You should read them before you start writing and try to address   questions that are being asked!

# Risk Assessment  
- As part of your Learning experience, under the Health and Safety  law it is a legal requirement to perform Risk Assessments on:  
	- Projects  
	- Industrial processes  
	- Experiments  
	- Hazardous jobs  
- The University’s Health, Safety & Wellbeing Services Unit provide a   comprehensive form for all u/g and p/g projects - you will probably   only have to complete pages 1-4.  
- The Risk Assessment form must be read, understood, completed   and signed by:  
	- yourself  
	- your supervisors   and submitted by your Supervisors the week after your project  proposal

# Ethical Approval  
- Also, as part of your Learning experience, you have to consider if   your project requires you to seek Ethical Approval from the College   Ethics committee before the project can continue  
- Typical situations where this is required are:  
	- Interviewing people  
	- Using people as test subjects  
	- Working with animals  
	- Using human biological material  
- The Ethical Approval Checklist form must be read, understood,   completed and signed by:  
	- yourself  
	- your supervisors   and submitted by your Supervisors the week after your project   proposal

# Assessments  
- Several components  
	- Project Proposal  
	- Introduction, Literature Review and Methodology  
	- Requirements, Design and Implementation, Testing and   Evaluation, Discussion, Critical Evaluation, Reflection  
	- Project Presentation and Final Product (must attend, otherwise   fail project)  
- Electronic submission of components using Turnitin via BB
-  Breakdown:
	1. Project proposal  - 10%  
	2. Literature review and Methodology - 15%  
	3. Abstract and Introduction  and Requirements to Conclusions - 35%  
	3. Work Done - 20%  
	3. Professional Working Practices - 10%  
	4. Presentation - 10%

# Avoid Plagiarism  
- Be aware and careful:  
	- do not copy from a book without proper referencing  
	- do not copy from the Web  
	- do not copy code …  
	- do not leave your computer unattended …  
	- do not give your best friend a disk with the ...  
- Level 6 (Final Year) penalty …  
	- zero mark for module  
	- all other modules capped at 40%  
		… which effectively makes it impossible to get anything higher than 3rd class Honours!
